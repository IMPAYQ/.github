## Building Privacy-Focused Payment Infrastructure on Aztec Network

ImpayQ is developing cutting-edge payment solutions on the Aztec Network that combine the transparency of blockchain with the privacy protections users deserve. Our mission is to create flexible, secure, and privacy-preserving financial infrastructure for the decentralized economy.

## Our Vision

We believe that privacy is a fundamental right that should not be sacrificed for functionality. ImpayQ aims to bridge the gap between traditional payment systems and blockchain technology, offering merchants and users a seamless experience while preserving their financial privacy.
